                  Building on nearly a decade of experience teaching and training English teachers in Thailand and South Korea, I continued my teaching journey in 2017 by teaching Kindergarten in Pacific Palisades, CA. While teaching, I developed a deeper interest in the tech industry and started learning Python and Javascript. I also got involved in the field by volunteering at various tech conferences held throughout Los Angeles.

                  Because of my continued interest in technology, passion to build things that solve real problems, and improving my technical skills, in 2021, I decided to transition from teaching to pursue a software development career. Although I will miss being in the classroom, I look forward to applying my teaching skills to new opportunities and challenges.
